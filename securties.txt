In the code we imported java BCryptPasswordEncoder to crypt the user password. This encryption
encrypts password in one way, so there is no way to look up original user password once it is in database. 
This is code used to encode the password

passwordEncoder.encode(password) 

Once the password is in database after registration, only way for user to verify the password and login
is to use passwordEncoder's match function

passwordEncoder.matches(password, storedPassword)

We retrieve user password using username

Select * from users where username = ?;

Once the retrieved password matches with the password entered by the user, backend will send a signal to frontend
then user is able to login.
